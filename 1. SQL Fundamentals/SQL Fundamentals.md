# SQL Fundamentals

Structured Query Language, or [[Computer Science/Programming/SQL/SQL]], as it’s better known as or SQL is a special‑purpose programming language. That differentiates it from other languages, like C, C++, JavaScript, or Java, which are all general‑purpose programming languages. This means that SQL has a very particular purpose, and that purpose is to manipulate sets of data.

Now typically, we manipulate those sets of data from what we call a relational database. Typically, because there are other kinds of databases or other kinds of data sources that we can use SQL against, and even if we can’t use SQL directly against these other data sources, most query languages today have some relationship to SQL.

Now SQL has a number of standards. It’s both an ANSI and an ISO standard, and this is only really important. because that means that each relational database vendor has to implement at least the standard so that you can know that if you learn the SQL standard, you can apply that to many different databases.

## SQL sublanguages

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases. There are several sub-languages within SQL that are used for different purposes. Here are some of the most common sub-languages of SQL:

1. **Data Definition Language (DDL):** This sub-language is used to define and manage the structure of a database. It includes commands such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP to create and modify tables, indexes, views, and other database objects.
2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** This sub-language is used to manipulate data within a database. It includes commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to retrieve, add, modify, and delete data in tables.
3. **Data Control Language (DCL):** This sub-language is used to manage access to a database. It includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE to grant and revoke privileges and permissions to users and roles.
4. **Transaction Control Language (TCL):** This sub-language is used to manage transactions in a database. It includes commands such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT to control the state and consistency of a transaction.
5. **Data Query Language (DQL):** This sub-language is used to query data from a database. It includes commands such as SELECT to retrieve data from one or more tables based on certain conditions.
6. **Data Definition Extension Language (DDEL):** This sub-language is used to extend the functionality of SQL by adding new data types, operators, and functions to the language.

These sub-languages are essential for working with relational databases and managing data effectively.


## Basic SQL Syntax

### Introduction

The basic syntax for executing commands against a database is known as a SQL statement. And a SQL statement, again, is just an expression that tells the database what you want it to do. It's going to take that expression, it's going to parse it into its component parts, and then it's going to execute that expression, assuming, of course, that your expression is a valid SQL expression. So let's see a SQL expression being built. First, here's SELECT first_name FROM person. And what's really important is to have a semicolon at the end of your command. Every valid SQL expression has a semicolon at the end.

SELECT first_name FROM person;

Now let's look at these different pieces of this expression and sort of parse it the way that a database would. So SELECT. SELECT is what's known as a keyword. In fact, it's a particular kind of a keyword called a command. In this course, and I think as a good practice, I'm going to have all the SQL keywords in uppercase and all of the identifiers like first_name in lowercase. FROM is also a keyword and person is also an identifier. Alright, so SELECT and FROM are the keywords, first_name and person are the identifiers. SELECT and FROM are part of the SQL specification. First_name and person refer to things inside of my database.

```SQL
SELECT first_name FROM person;
```

## SQL DataTypes

The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer character, money, date and time, binary, and so on. Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

## MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0)

### String Data Types

| Data type                   | Description                                                  |

| VARBINARY(size)             | Equal to VARCHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The _size_ parameter specifies the maximum column length in bytes. |

| SET(val1, val2, val3, ...)  | A string object that can have 0 or more values, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 64 values in a SET list |

### Numeric Data Types

| Data type                     | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BIT(_size_)                   | A bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in _size_. The _size_ parameter can hold a value from 1 to 64. The default value for _size_ is 1. |

| FLOAT(_size_, _d_)            | A floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in _size_. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the _d_ parameter. This syntax is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.17, and it will be removed in future MySQL versions |
| FLOAT(_p_)                    | A floating point number. MySQL uses the _p_ value to determine whether to use FLOAT or DOUBLE for the resulting data type. If _p_ is from 0 to 24, the data type becomes FLOAT(). If _p_ is from 25 to 53, the data type becomes DOUBLE() |
| DOUBLE(_size_, _d_)           | A normal-size floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in _size_. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the _d_ parameter |

| DECIMAL(_size_, _d_)          | An exact fixed-point number. The total number of digits is specified in _size_. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the _d_ parameter. The maximum number for _size_ is 65. The maximum number for _d_ is 30. The default value for _size_ is 10. The default value for _d_ is 0. |
| DEC(_size_, _d_)              | Equal to DECIMAL(size,d)                                     |

**Note:** All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for the column. If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the UNSIGNED attribute to the column.

### Date and Time Data Types

| Data type        | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

### SQL Date Data Types

**MySQL** comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:

- `DATE` - format YYYY-MM-DD
- `DATETIME` - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
- `TIMESTAMP` - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
- `YEAR` - format YYYY or YY
  

**SQL Server** comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:

- `DATE` - format YYYY-MM-DD
- `DATETIME` - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
- `SMALLDATETIME` - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
- `TIMESTAMP` - format: a unique number
  

**Note:** The date types are chosen for a column when you create a new table in your database!

**Tip:** To keep your queries simple and easy to maintain, do not use time-components in your dates, unless you have to!
